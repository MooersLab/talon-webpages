# talon-webpages: Open favorite web pages by voice command.

## Purpose

The file `websites.talon` is provided to stimulate customization.

## Installation

Store *contractions.talon* inside `~/.talon/users/<whatever>/`.
The subfolder <whatever> can have any name and is optional.
Talon Voice will automatically detect this file and all others inside `~/.talon/users/` without restaring Talon Voice.

You can add more contractions by using a text editor.
The *contractions.talon* file is a plain text file written in TalonScript which is a subset of Python.
