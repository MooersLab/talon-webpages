# talon-webpages: Open favorite web pages by voice command

## Purpose
The file *websites.talon* is provided to stimulate customization.
You likely have different favorite websites.
Adapt to suit your needs and interests.

The file is run by the program Talon Voice.
[Talon Voice](https://talonvoice.com/docs/index.html) is an open source project that is wrapped with Python and that is highly customizable via either TalonScript or Python scripts.

## Disclaimer
This is a programming tool, not an educational tool.
It provides no explanations and no context.

## Installation
Store *websites.talon* inside `~/.talon/users/<whatever>/`.
The subfolder <whatever> can have any name and is optional.
Talon Voice will automatically detect this file and all others inside `~/.talon/users/` without restarting Talon Voice.

You can add more contractions by using a text editor.
The *websites.talon* file is a plain text file written in TalonScript, a Python subset.

## Operation
The commands work only when the cursor is inside a web browser, and the web browser is the current active application in the foreground of your desktop.
